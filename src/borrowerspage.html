            Household Appliance Financing
          </h3>
          <p>
            PadiPay launched this consumer product loan to help its customers
            buy essential household appliances. These include things like
            laptops, televisions, and refrigerators. Whatever product you name,
            we'll buy it and offer it to you for cost plus profit. PadiPay will
            thereafter demand you to make a monthly repayment from your earnings
            for a period of time not to exceed 24 months following the purchase
            of the product.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-medium pb-9 text-lg">Working Capital Financing</h3>
          <p>
            Based on the idea of a capital finance facility, this choice
            operates. This was developed by PadiPay to generally support the
            financial requirements of your company. As a result, you can use
            this option to leverage funding for the purchase of shares,
            merchandise, etc. You must procure the products and provide a
            proforma invoice to the Bank in order to receive this facility. We
            send a straight payment to your supplier as soon as we get this (the
            pro forma invoice). However, this loan option's repayment is
            contingent upon consent.

            Project Financing/Constructing
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this case, you make a request, and following an agreement, the
            project is built and sold to you at cost plus a profit margin. You
            receive ownership of the project when it is finished, and you have
            the option of paying back the loan in full or in installments.
